| **General & UI/UX** |                 |                                 |                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| FR001          | UI - Theme        | Gradient Background             | As a user, I want to see a visually appealing and consistent gradient background theme throughout the app. | The app should utilize a reusable radiant glow background (e.g., `linear-gradient(to bottom, #F5E3E6, #D9E4F5)` or similar dreamy gradients). This styling should be integrated consistently across all components and pages.                                                                                                                              |
| FR002          | UI - Theme        | Light/Dark Mode Toggle          | As a user, I want to switch between light and dark modes easily to suit my preference or environment.     | A toggle button, likely in the header, should allow users to switch between light and dark themes with a single click. Gradient backgrounds and glow effects must adapt correctly to both modes. Ensure theme-specific content renders correctly after component mounting (use state to track mounting, provide fallback UI for SSR).              |
| FR003          | UI - Responsiveness | Responsive Design               | As a user, I want the website to look and work well on different devices, including desktop and mobile. | The layout should adapt fluidly to various screen sizes. The header should incorporate a menu button for navigation on smaller (mobile) screens.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| FR004          | UI - Animations   | Micro-animations & Glow Effects | As a user, I want interactive elements to provide subtle visual feedback, enhancing the dreamy vibe.      | Implement micro-animations on elements like the hero section title ("Dreams" part). Interactive buttons should have a subtle, dreamy glow effect on hover and potentially when active. Input/Output boxes (Journal page) should have a subtle, dynamic, moving/pulsing glow animation around their border to indicate focus/activity (dimmer on inactive side). |
| FR005          | UI - Header       | Application Header              | As a user, I need a consistent header for navigation and accessing key features like theme toggle and user profile/login. | A responsive header should be present on relevant pages, containing navigation links (or a menu button on mobile), the light/dark mode toggle, and a user icon for login/signup/profile access.                                                                                                                                          |
| FR006          | UI - Footer       | Application Footer              | As a user, I want to find basic information and quick links at the bottom of the pages.                   | A footer should be present containing branding elements (logos) and quick links to relevant sections like 'About', 'Pricing', etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| FR007          | UI - Components   | Component Library               | As a developer, I want to use a consistent set of UI components for efficiency and visual harmony.        | Utilize `shadcn/ui` components and `Lucide React` icons for building the interface, styled with Tailwind CSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Authentication** |                 |                                 |                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| FR008          | Auth              | User Registration/Login         | As a new visitor, I want to be able to sign up or log in to save and manage my dreams.                    | Implement middleware to protect iDreamify's "/journal", "/dreamspace", and "/tracker" routes, keeping "/", "/pricing", and "/about" public. Configure the system to automatically redirect unauthenticated users attempting to access protected pages to the sign-in page. Ensure that clicking protected navigation links or directly accessing their URLs prompts unauthenticated users to authenticate. After successful sign-in, users must be redirected to the specific protected page they originally requested. Utilize Clerk.js for a seamless modal-based authentication flow while maintaining the "Home Journal DreamSpace Tracker Pricing About" navigation order.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| FR009          | Auth              | Session Management              | As a logged-in user, I want the application to remember me across sessions.                               | The backend must handle user sessions securely. The frontend should reflect the logged-in state (e.g., showing user-specific content, changing header options).                                                                                                                                                                               |
| FR010          | Auth              | Post-Login Redirect             | As a user, after logging in or signing up, I want to be taken directly to the journaling section.       | Upon successful authentication (login or registration), the user should be automatically redirected to the "Journal" page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Home Page**    |                 |                                 |                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| FR011          | Home              | Hero Section Content            | As a visitor, I want to quickly understand what iDremify offers from the main landing page section.     | The hero section should display the headline "Unlock the Wisdom of Your Dreams" (with "Dreams" distinctively colored, e.g., `text-dream-purple`, potentially animated) and descriptive text ("Discover hidden meanings...").                                                                                                                    |
| FR012          | Home              | Hero Section CTAs               | As a visitor, I want clear calls to action to either get started or see the community in DreamSpace.                           | Two action buttons should be present: "Start Dream Journal" (triggers login/signup popover that redirrects to Journal page) and "DreamSpace" (initiate the popup login/singup and after successfull log in the user is dirrected than to the public/shared dreams page named DreamSpace). Buttons should have the specified glow/hover effects. The effect used on these buttons is a "glowing border" effect created using CSS gradients, pseudo-elements (::before), and keyframe animations. The :before pseudo-element creates a larger background behind the button with a moving gradient, and a blur filter is applied to give it a glow appearance. The overflow: hidden on the button hides the parts of the pseudo-element that extend beyond the button's rounded corners. The animation (@keyframes glowing) shifts the background position of the gradient over time.                                                                                                                                        |
| FR013          | Home              | Features Section                | As a visitor, I want to see the key features of the platform explained clearly.                           | Below the hero section, display feature cards (e.g., Track, Analyse & Interpret, Dream Journal, AI Interpretation, etc.) with brief descriptions. Cards should have a gradient style and dreamy glowing hover effects.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Journal Page** |                 |                                 |                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| FR014          | Journal           | Page Access                     | As a logged-in user, I want to access the Journal page to record and interpret my dreams.                 | The "Journal" page should only be accessible to authenticated users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| FR015          | Journal           | Layout                          | As a user, I want a clear layout for entering my dream and seeing its interpretation side-by-side.        | Implement a clean two-column layout: "Dream Notes" on the left, "Interpreter" on the right, separated by a line divider. Both sections should be visually distinct (e.g., rounded rectangles with light gray borders and the specified subtle border glow animation moving through the border lines).                                                                           |
| FR016          | Journal - Notes   | Dream Input (Text)              | As a user, I want to type my dream description into a dedicated area.                                     | The left "Dream Notes" section should have a text area labeled "Describe your dream" with placeholder text (e.g., "Write your dream here...").                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| FR017          | Journal - Notes   | Dream Input (Voice)             | As a user, I might want to dictate my dream instead of typing.                                            | Provide an option for voice input, which should be transcribed into text and populate the dream description text area. (Requires browser speech recognition API or similar).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| FR018          | Journal - Notes   | Date Selection                  | As a user, I want to easily select the date the dream occurred.                                           | Provide a "Select Date" button/icon. Clicking it should open a popover calendar for date selection. The selected date should be displayed (e.g., in the "Dream Notes" header, which defaults to the current date).
